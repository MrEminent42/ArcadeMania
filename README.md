# ArcadeMania

## Inspiration: 
Our project was based off of retro arcade games as its main theme, however, our initial inspiration could be seen from carnivals, as we wanted to mimic the experience that carnival mini games created with a hint of nostalgia for the past.
## What it does
Our game spawns you in a hub zone where you can choose 4 different machines to play from and a character to interact with. By interacting with each machine you will be taken to different mini games which reward tickets. After gathering 60 tickets you can play the final platformer game.
## How we built it
We built ArcadeMania in Unity, mostly using manual testing and learning as we went.
## Challenges we ran into
Our biggest challenge was definitely the fact that none of us knew anything about Unity or C# at the start of the event, and the learning curve was quite steep.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Some accomplishments we were proud of were getting the tickets to be obtainable in any location, having the games and hub switch back and forth reasonably seamlessly, and creating original sprites that enhanced the theme of our project.
## What we learned
We learned a ton about how Unity and C# work as well as the depth of bugs that game development will bring.
## What's next for ArcaneMania
If we were to continue this project, we had multiple ideas for a second hub area that would be unlocked after the final game, unlocking more activities including another secret room and final boss battle.
